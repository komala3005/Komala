1. Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Includes ~80 features (lot size, neighborhood, year built, etc.)

Great for feature engineering and model experimentation



2. Scikit-learn’s Boston Housing Dataset (Deprecated)

Avoid for new projects due to ethical concerns (can still be used for educational purposes)



3. Zillow’s Public Data
Link: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

Real, large-scale housing data in the US



4. UCI Machine Learning Repository – Housing Data
Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

Smaller datasets like the California Housing dataset

Smart Regression Techniques to Apply:

Linear Regression (baseline model)

Ridge & Lasso Regression (regularization to handle multicollinearity)

Random Forest Regressor (non-linear, handles feature interactions)

Gradient Boosting Machines (like XGBoost or LightGBM)

Neural Networks / Deep Learning (if large dataset is available)

Stacking or Ensemble Models (combine predictions from multiple regressors)
